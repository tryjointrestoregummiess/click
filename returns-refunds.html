             <h4>Improving Our Products & Customer Service</h4>
             <p>We are always looking for ways to improve our products and our customer service. We ask that when you are requesting a refund, that you let us know why the product didn’t work for you or why you want to refund. We’d love to hear your recommendations or suggestions to help us improve the experience for others.</p>
             <p>Please note: This is optional and not a requirement for your refund, just a simple request from us as a team. Your feedback is valued.</p>
             <h4>How Our Returns Work</h4>
             <p>If for any reason you are not totally happy with your purchase, you can notify us within 60 days of your order and arrange a return. To obtain a full refund, please return all bottles from your order, be they empty, partially full, or full. These must be sent back to our fulfillment center at the address listed below within 60 (sixty) days of your order date. If your entire order is not received and processed by our fulfillment center within 60 days of your order date, we will not issue your refund. In this event, any goods received will not be returned to you.</p>
             <p>Along with your returned order, you must include full details relating to your order, including your order ID (found in your order receipt sent by email), your full name, your full address where your order was sent, your email address, and your phone number. These must all be clearly legible so our fulfillment center can identify your order and process your refund. Please reach out to our team if you are having any trouble with this process.</p>
             <p>Once our fulfillment center has received all of the above, we will be able to process your refund. Your refund will be credited back to your chosen payment method within 5-10 business days. This also depends on the processing speed of your bank. If you do not meet these requirements we will be unable to process your refund. The customer must pay for the shipping to return products to us.</p>
